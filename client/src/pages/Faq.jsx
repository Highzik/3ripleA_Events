          <p className="fw-semibold">Our team of expert planners are at our best when we are building any kind of event from the ground up, whether that be at a private estate, on a beachfront property, in a historic venue with lots of rules and regulations, or at a private club with limited access. We can transform any space imaginable and specialize in events with challenging logistics. We make the impossible possible.</p>

          <p className="fw-semibold">Our founder, Abimbola, created 3ripleA Events in ****. After her service (NYSC) to her mother's land, she decided to start an event planning company. She found she enjoyed connecting with people and using her skills to bring out the joys and celebrations in life.</p>

          <h3 className="fs-6 fw-bold mb-4 mt-4">HOW MUCH SHOULD I EXPECT TO BUDGET FOR MY EVENT?</h3>
          <p className="fw-semibold">It is easiest to think of the overall budget in terms of price per person. Our typical clients expect to spend an entry-level amount of around **** per person on their event.</p>

          <h3 className="fs-6 fw-bold mb-4 mt-4">HOW MANY EVENTS DO YOU TAKE ON IN A YEAR?</h3>
          <p className="fw-semibold">Because of the high level of involvement of myself and my team in each one of our events, we aim to take no more than 4-6 events annually.</p>

          <h3 className="fs-6 fw-bold mb-4 mt-4">WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE PLANNING DESTINATION EVENTS?</h3>
          <p className="fw-semibold">Nearly all of the events we plan are destination celebrations! Our clients hail from all over, so we are very familiar with juggling time zones. Additionally, we have built an amazing network of creative vendors all around the globe who we can tap for any event no matter how remote. Within 3ripleA Events, we have a travel concierge who handles all the logistics of a destination event from flights to hotels and beyond.</p>

          <p className="fw-semibold">We do not offer partial planning!</p>

          <h3 className="fs-6 fw-bold mb-4 mt-4">I HAVE TALKED TO OTHER PLANNERS AND FIND THAT EVERYONE CHARGES DIFFERENTLY. HOW DOES YOUR PRICING STRUCTURE WORK?</h3>
          <p className="fw-semibold">This is my favorite question! Our fee structure is a three-part structure that compensates us for the three elements of what we are building for you over the course of our engagement together: planning, design + production, and event management. We go over the budget in depth during the planning and design stage.
